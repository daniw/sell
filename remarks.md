# Remarks on the first presentation

[Back](README.md)

## General feedback
- more aggressive cake scene (do a bakery scene)
- do not swallow words (speak loud AND clear)
- do the dialog more slowly and relaxed
- the cake must be seen by the audience
- location -- name where it is (peripheral Lucerne, Adligenswil) and what it is (business rooms / computer science course rooms)
- show, demonstrate or mention suitable example projects (Tesla Coil)
- show some impressions (photographs, homepage, wiki, IRC, ...)
- mention the "interest vs. commercial" philosophy

## Diction, phrases and pronounciation
- Suggested expressions
    - "set up a club" / (founded a club)
    - "free exchange of ideas"
    - "permanently installed"
    - "refuse a connection"
- use "techies" instead of "freaks" (a no-go word)
- be careful with the pronounciation of the word "recipe"
- use the term "board" for "Vorstand"
